    Use apt-get instead of apt to install python-minimal.

    Using apt does not refresh the package mirrors (for packer build run within
    Jenkins) and fails with "E: Unable to locate package python-minimal"
    to install python-minimal.

    With apt issue is reproducable:

    Use apt-get instead as a workaround to resolve the package from the mirrors
    sussessfully:
